# Brain-Stroke-Prediction-using-ML-Models
This project develops a machine learning model to predict stroke risk using health and demographic data. Analyzing a dataset of 5,110 patients, models like XGBoost, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes were trained and evaluated. The goal is to provide accurate predictions to support early intervention in healthcare.
